# NOTE: this isn't don't automatically as I don't want agents floating around 
#       everywhere- an agent will only be started specifically when I start one.
#       BUT- if I land on a host where an agent is running, it should connect 
#       automatically (hence, source the keychain file if it exists) 
#
# NOTE: include AddKeysToAgent in ~/.ssh/config to have them automatically added 
#       to the agent upon first use
