# This is Chad Lake's .zshenv file:     #
#                                       #
# This file is executed by every shell  #
# e.g.: aliases, path, env variables    #
#                                       #

# this file is empty as all shell config 
# stuff is kept in .zshrc; the distinction
# has become basically meaningless and it
# causes some issues with sudo (particularly
# having fpath defined here)
